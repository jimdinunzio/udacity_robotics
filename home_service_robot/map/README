The student should include a brief write-up explaining the packages used for this project,
covering localization, mapping and navigation.

In this final home service robot project we combined multiple packages to achieve a desired and useful
robot behavior. First, we used the ROS gmapping package to run laser-based SLAM along with turtlebot_teleop
for keyboard control and build and save a map of our environment.
Next with the map in hand we used the AMCL probablistic localization system using a particle filter to track the
pose of our robot. Finally we used the ROS Navigation stack based on Dijkstra's algorithm to plan our robot's
path from the pick up location to the drop off location. We also created a virtual object to show at the pick
up location, then disappear when the robot reaches it and and show up at the drop off point when the robot
reaches the drop off point. All together quite a satisfying combination of many areas we have learned in this
nano degree program.
